# PlatformIO file ignore rules

# This firmware integrates watchfaces via wrappers under src/os/.
# Many upstream watchface projects include standalone entrypoints
# (global watch instance + setup/loop) or are meant to be included
# directly by those wrappers. If PlatformIO compiles them as separate
# translation units, the link fails with multiple-definition errors.

# Auto-generated / upstream standalone wrappers
src/watchfaces/**/*__*.cpp

# Upstream standalone PlatformIO/Arduino entrypoints

# Specific sources that are included by wrappers (not compiled directly)
src/watchfaces/QLock/src/QLock.cpp

# Standalone sketch-style entrypoint (integrated version uses Watchy_Mario.*)
